Testing some posts. Does it work? Testing some math functions. Is this $\sum_i^N a_i$ ?

\begin{equation}
\sum_i^N a_i = B_{e} 
\end{equation}

This is an inline code `func(x)`

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's

> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is _hello_  written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.
